## A Broken Trust with Alco Windows and Doors
In August 2023, I signed a contract with Alco Windows and Doors to install impact windows, a requirement from my HOA for insurance purposes. 
Initially, Alco communicated frequently and efficiently, leading me to trust them. 
However, once they received full payment, the situation changed dramatically. 
While I continued paying interest on the financing arranged through a third party, Alco received the money upfront and has yet to deliver. 
This document details my experience and how it mirrors a disturbing pattern among other customers.

## From Agreement to Payment: A Promising Start
Like many other customers, I was lured by Alco’s professional reputation and positive reviews. 
Their communication was impeccable up until the point they received full payment. 
The financing arrangement meant I was immediately responsible for payments, despite the fact that no work had been done. 
Alco received their money in full, leaving me in a precarious financial position while 
I awaited the installation of my windows—an installation that still has not occurred.

## The Breakdown: No Progress, No Communication
Despite numerous follow-ups, there has been no meaningful progress. 
My HOA president has been involved, and the city even issued a permit expiration warning due to the lack of activity. 
However, Alco has remained unresponsive. 
This disturbing lack of communication, despite the looming threat of hurricane season, 
reveals a disregard for customer commitments once the company is paid in full.

## Luis Alvarez: The Man Behind the Public Persona
![Luis Alvarez, Managing Director of Alco](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQEV2r4zV0s9NA/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1701800543657?e=1729123200&v=beta&t=H78uLZZLG3BErTI-GbWMLRAxblVokjYJiSD23gis08Y)

Luis Alvarez, the Managing Director of Alco Windows and Doors, has an active online presence, painting a picture of a successful business leader. 
He promotes his company through platforms like LinkedIn, where his [profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-alvarez-0a7a7b57/) emphasizes 
his expertise in SEO strategies often used to present an artificially favorable image online. 
His [Power100 Business Profile](https://power100.io/luis-alvarez-ceo-lander/) also highlights his achievements and his expertise in SEO. 
However, the public image crafted by Alvarez sharply contrasts with my experience, where unresponsiveness and failure to deliver have been the norm.

## Alco's Public Presence: Transparency and Accountability
In addition to my personal experience, it is important to highlight the public profiles and credentials of the individuals responsible for Alco Windows and Doors. 
The founder and Managing Director, Luis Alvarez, has built a strong online presence, positioning himself as a successful business leader.
 He is active on multiple platforms, which appear to be part of an effort to shape public perception.

This public presence raises an important question: how does a company that presents itself so favorably online have such a stark contrast between 
its public image and the real-world experiences of its customers? 
Luis Alvarez’s apparent expertise in SEO might explain how the company maintains a positive online presence despite the troubling complaints on sites like 
the [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/doral/profile/impact-windows/alco-windows-and-doors-llc-0633-90414965).


## The Deception of Reviews and BBB Complaints
Alco prominently displays its positive Google reviews on its website, suggesting a company committed to customer satisfaction. 
However, a deeper look into more recent reviews tells a different story. 
Their [Google Maps page](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Alco+Windows+and+Doors/@25.786464,-80.343327,16z/data=!4m14!1m7!3m6!1s0x88d9b8e4d8421cd1:0x65841e77fdc48647!2sAlco+Windows+and+Doors!8m2!3d25.786464!4d-80.3407467!16s%2Fg%2F11dxdkybdg!3m5!1s0x88d9b8e4d8421cd1:0x65841e77fdc48647!8m2!3d25.786464!4d-80.3407467!16s%2Fg%2F11dxdkybdg?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDkxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) 
reveals a stark contrast, with recent negative reviews being overshadowed by older, more favorable ones.

On top of this, Alco has accumulated 44 complaints with the [Better Business Bureau (BBB)](https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/doral/profile/impact-windows/alco-windows-and-doors-llc-0633-90414965/complaints) 
over the past three years—31 of them in just the last year—largely citing delays, poor customer service, and failure to deliver. 
The situation became so egregious that they eventually [lost their BBB accreditation](https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/doral/profile/impact-windows/alco-windows-and-doors-llc-0633-90414965).

## Parallels in Customer Experiences: Joseph Johnson’s Story
I am not alone in my frustrations. 
A story reported by [NBC Miami](https://www.nbcmiami.com/responds/after-months-of-waiting-man-turns-to-nbc6-responds-for-help-with-home-improvement-project/3365036/) 
in July 2024 describes how Joseph Johnson, another Alco customer, faced nearly identical issues. 
Like me, Joseph signed a contract with Alco to make his home hurricane-ready and financed the project through a third party. 
He too began making payments immediately, while Alco’s communication dwindled.

His HOA approved the project in January 2023, but Alco did not proceed. 
Months passed with no progress, and Joseph filed complaints with state authorities. 
It wasn't until NBC6 got involved that Alco finally applied for the permits. 
Joseph ultimately canceled the contract and requested a refund, receiving no explanation for the delays.

## A Repeated Pattern of Delay and Abuse
Just as Joseph experienced, my situation with Alco Windows and Doors follows the same troubling pattern:
- **Arranged Financing Through a Third Party**: Both of us began making payments immediately, despite no work being completed.
- **Prompt HOA Approval**: Both of our HOAs approved the projects promptly, but Alco delayed.
- **Communication Breakdown**: After receiving payment, Alco became unresponsive.
- **Project Delays**: Despite having permits, Alco did not move forward with the installations.
- **Financial Burden**: Both of us faced financial strain, paying for undelivered services during critical times like hurricane season.

These cases—and others reflected in BBB complaints—indicate a pattern of behavior that exploits customers financially and emotionally.

## What Comes Next: Holding Alco Accountable
The stories of customers like Joseph Johnson and myself suggest a larger systemic issue with Alco Windows and Doors. 
Their reliance on SEO and positive reviews to present a trustworthy front is contradicted by numerous complaints and failures. 
With hurricane season already here, it’s more critical than ever to hold companies like Alco accountable for their actions, both legally and publicly.
